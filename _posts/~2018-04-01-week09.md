The table columns should be "week #", "contribution", "contribution type". The first column should just include the week number in which you made your Contributions. The second column should contain the name of the project/site to which the contribution was made and a link to your specific contribution and a brief description ("article edit", "issue reported", "pull request", â€¦). The third column should state what type of contribution in is: "course website", "Wikipedia", "Other".

<a href="/cs480_s18/contributions">Contributions</a>

after line 31 (or after the line that contains the link to the About page, <a href="/cs480_s18/about">About</a>).
