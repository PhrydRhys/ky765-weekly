### Explain (in your own words) the difference between software development following the cathedral model and software development following the bazaar model; which of the two environments would you be more comfortable?
The two models, the cathedral and bazaar, are metaphors for how most software development is done, where Raymond _____________
#### Cathedral
This model is the typical commercial model, where the development process is hidden from the typical user, and the ________
#### Bazaar
The bazaar model is, as its name stats, an environment __________________

### The Cathedral and The Bazaar essay has 19 "lessons"; pick two that you found most interesting, intriguing, telling, or that you simply liked; quote them in your blog and try to explain what they supposed to mean
The two lessons I have found most noteworthy to talk about are the Xth and 19th quotes.

#### Lesson#: (Quote)
This lesson is ___________

#### 19: Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.
The last quote is interesting to me because of how simple and intuitive it is. There is practically not much to it, since it is pretty much a true statement and there is no argument against it. It should be obvious that if a community has a fast and convenient to commuicate and share ideas, and nobody is forced against their interest to participate in a community, then of course more developers will lead to a better product. Perhaps the allure of this quote is how conspicuous the idea is; you will of course be able to work better with more people who each can contribute their own unique and brilliant ideas, given that communication and friction are not able to hinder development.

However, aside from how simple and non-subjective this lesson feels, there is one thing that any reader of this quote should pay attention to: Raymond says "many heads are _**inevitably**_ better than one". This is possibly the "caveat" to this quote, where there is no doubt that, in the long run, many contributors to project will lead to the best possible development, but that does not mean many contributors will be the best course of action in the short run. Given a deadline, a relatively short time to roll out a product, you may not be able to afford many heads, because this could lead to more time for discussion of the direction of a product instead of actual development. But rather than me saying that you should not have many people contributing to a product, I instead want to say that when working on any project, be mindful of the amount of time and resources you have: can I afford to have a lot of people to work together at the expense of the time of release, or do I need to limit discussion time to allow more development time?

Luckily for version control and open source, a lot of times we are able to produce a product and put it out there, and then be able to eventually push improvements afterwards, which means that more heads are not only "inevitably better than one", but also the better decision in the long term, given that friction and communication issues are not prevalent.
