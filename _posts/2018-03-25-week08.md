## Humanitarian Projects
Going off the Merrian Webster dictionary's definition of "humanitarian", I would think that most projects (that I've encountered so far) are aimed to "improve the lives and living conditions of other people", because I don't know of an open source project that aims to harm others intentionally, because not only would such a malicious project would be publically know and probably get shutdown before development gets deep, but also because I (mostly) trust that "given enough eyes," there will be someone who is good-nature and will probably bring up the non-humanitarian nature of the project.

More specifically, I was looking at matplotlib, not only because I was in the group that looked it up during our class exercise, but also because I was using it in my Intro to Machine Learning class and wanted more insight on how the project was. As an indirect competitor to Matlab, it helps people who want to do graphy stuff, and also pushes matlab to be better, i.e.e competition is good for product refinement. Since it technically improves the live of people using data and modelling data, which such data and modelling can be used in projects that directly help the lives of people in need, I would consider matplotlib as a humanitarian project. Using similar logic like this, most projects will be humanitrian is some aspect, though some more than others.

## [Progress on Group Project](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django-team/blob/master/minutes-2018-03-22.md)
So far, progress towards contributing was going pretty well, including downloading the developer environment of Django, joining the maling list of developers, and signing up for its IRC chat. However, we kind of hit a wall when we realized that, while Django's bug tracker is relatively well organized, there are simply not enough tickets on the tracker. As stated in our documentation of our last meeting (Thurs 5-7pm @ our alternate time, since we changed out primary time to Wednesday 2-4pm and Wednesday was a snow day), "the last easy pickings ticket was opened 5 hours" (5 hours before our meeting time), which means that we need to quickly get dibs on new issues because the number of doable issues is really small. I proposed the possibility of needing to find an alternate project, in the worst case scenario that we will be unable to find a bug to work on, and also suggested that we discuss this possible impediment as soon as possible with Joanna. Unfortunately, the alternatives that we looked at on Thursday don't seem any easier. However, one out I can think of is submitting our own issues to the bug tracker, which may be more difficult because actively looking for bugs, let alone a reproduceable one, is not always easy to do. Hopefully, in the end, we will be able to stick with Django and be able to contribute in a meaningful way.

Perosnally, I will keep an eye on easy-pickings tickets, because if we are to stay with Django, it is crucial that we find issues to work on, in order to be able to successfully contribute.
In addition, I will also need to discuss our alternate meeting time with my teammates and provide my schedule to them because future Thursdays @ 5-7pm will not work.
