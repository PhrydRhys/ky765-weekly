## Humanitarian Projects
Going off the Merrian Webster dictionary's definition of "humanitarian", I would think that most projects (that I've encountered so far) are aimed to "improve the lives and living conditions of other people", because I don't know of a project that aims to harm others intentionally.

## [Progress on Group Project](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django-team/blob/master/minutes-2018-03-22.md)
So far, progress towards contributing was going pretty well, including downloading the developer environment of Django, joining the maling list of developers, and signing up for its IRC chat. However, we kind of hit a wall when we realized that, while Django's bug tracker is relatively well organized, there are simply not enough tickets on the tracker. As stated in our documentation of our last meeting (Thurs 5-7pm @ our alternate time, since we changed out primary time to Wednesday 2-4pm and Wednesday was a snow day), "the last easy pickings ticket was opened 5 hours" (5 hours before our meeting time), which means that we need to quickly get dibs on new issues because the number of doable issues is really small. I proposed the possibility of needing to find an alternate project, in the worst case scenario that we will be unable to find a bug to work on, and also suggested that we discuss this possible impediment as soon as possible with Joanna. Unfortunately, the alternatives that we looked at on Thursday don't seem any easier. However, one out I can think of is submitting our own issues to the bug tracker, which may be more difficult because actively looking for bugs, let alone a reproduceable one, is not always easy to do. Hopefully, in the end, we will be able to stick with Django and be able to contribute in a meaningful way.

Perosnally, I will keep an eye on easy-pickings tickets, because if we are to stay with Django, it is crucial that we find issues to work on, in order to be able to successfully contribute.
In addition, I will also need to discuss our alternate meeting time with my teammates and provide my schedule to them because Thursdays 5-7pm for [Rohit](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/rdm403-weekly) do not look feasible anymore.

Requirements:
- According to the Merrian Webster dictionary, the definition of the word humanitarian (adj) is "relating to or characteristic of people who work to improve the lives and living conditions of other people".   Consider the open source projects that you are familiar with (not necesserily the one that you are working on in this class). Could any of them  be classified as humanitarian  or having humanitarian aspect? Explain. 

- report on the progress that you group made for your project

- what is the next thing that you (as an individual) will be working on (as part of your team project)?
