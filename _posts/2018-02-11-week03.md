### Wikipedia Contribution
My choice in article was based off my interest in gaming, and I eventually looked up OpenAI's page about its bot for the computer game called [DOTA 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2). I was watching the tournament for the game called [The International 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_2017) (TI7), and there was a segment where OpenAI had presented its bot against a professional player, and it convincingly won 2 games before the professional player gave up.

Thus, as someone who likes playing games and playing against challenging AI, I wanted to look more into OpenAI's bot, which the details of it was provided by company in [two](https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/) (blogs)(https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/), which are a short but nice read. When browsing the wikipedia page for OpenAI, I realized that the second blog was never added as a reference for the Wikipedia article, and I believed that the second article is relevant not only because it provides direct insight about a project of OpenAI, but also because the first artcle was cited even though it did not provide much insight on the development process of the bot. Therefore, I added that url in the reference. Hopefully my edit doesn't get reverted anytime soon, or that would be embarrassing and quite heartbreaking to see.
