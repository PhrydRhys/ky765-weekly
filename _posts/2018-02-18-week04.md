### Fixing Course Website Issue
* [Original Issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/5)
* [Pull Request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/53)
#### After my Claim was Approved
After claiming my issue, I decided that, because the issue is relatively easy to fix, I would just made the change on the GitHub website itself. Thus, after Joanna approved my claim, I went to the source of the issue in the footer.html file on [line 5](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/footer.html#L5) and changed "Fall 2017" to "Spring 2018". While the URL of the calendar was disccused, I was not sure if I should be the one making the change because [another issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/23) detailed the problem, and I did not want to take away a change that another student might needed to make.

(My thanks to Dora and Daisy for providing the source of the footer issue and link for correct calendar, respectively)
