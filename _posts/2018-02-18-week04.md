#### This week's blog:
In your blogs for this week describe the following things:
1) Post the link to the pull request that you submitted. Describe step by step what you did to complete the fix and the pull request. You should specifiy all git commands you executed and any other steps that were required. (Basically describe what you did from the momemnt you got the issue to be fixed assigned to you, untill you submitted the pull request). 
2) Describe your code triage experience so far. List the projects that you selected when you signed up for the website. Specify the bugs/issues that you examined based on the emails that you got from the CodeTriage website (if you have not gotten any emails, then change your settings so you start receiving them). For each bug/issue that you examined describe what you thought about it (even if you did not end up taking any action on the bug/issue itself).
If you do not complete the pull request for the website fix by the end of Sunday, simply add the response to part 1 early next week when you get it done.
