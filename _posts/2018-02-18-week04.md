## Fixing Course Website Issue
* [Original Issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/5)
* [Pull Request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/53)
#### After my Claim was Approved
After claiming my issue, I decided that, because the issue is relatively easy to fix, I would just made the change on the GitHub website itself. Thus, after Joanna approved my claim, I went to the source of the issue in the footer.html file on [line 5](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/footer.html#L5) and changed "Fall 2017" to "Spring 2018". While the URL of the calendar was disccused (the current one links to the correct NYU Academic calendar page, but incorrect section of Fall 2017), I was not sure if I should be the one making the change because [another issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/23) detailed the problem, and I did not want to take away a change that another student might needed to make. Afterwards, I made my commit, pull request, and asked [Ryan](https://github.com/rchau0623) to verify if my change was adequate or not.

#### Making an Additional Fix
Later, Joanna clarified that, because the URL was discussed in the issue, I should be making that fix as well. Thus, I needed to made another commit on [line 5](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/footer.html#L5) again, by changing the anchor for the calendar page, and also adding the secure tag for HTTP:
```
http://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/university-academic-calendar.html#1168
```
to
```
https://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/university-academic-calendar.html#1184
```
While making the additional fix was not hard, I did not know how to make another commit within the same pull request. A quick Google search did not yield a clear answer, so I decided that worse comes to worst, I would create [another pull request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/57) and refernece it in a comment in my first one, and if I so happen to learn how to create another commit within the same pull request in the future, I would close my second post.

...Unfortunately, I shortly learned how to make a new commit moments after I made my second post. Thus, I embarrassingly closed my second post and made the additional commit on my first one.
#### Running Git through Terminal
If I somehow couldn't make the changes on the GitHub website, then I would have gone through these steps with terminal:

1) Clone the course website repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git
```

2) Fork the repository through Github on the [course website repository](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18) to add to my own [GitHub account's repository](https://github.com/PhrydRhys/cs480_s18)

3) Add the fork address as the remote for the local repository:
```
$ git remote add myfork https://github.com/PhrydRhys/cs480_s18.git
```

4) Change into the directory of _includes to find the _footer.html_ file:
```
$ cd PATH_OF_REPO/cs480_s18/_includes/
```

5) Create a new branch for my fix:
```
$ git branch BRANCH_NAME
```
6) Switch to the new branch:
```
$ git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```
7) Fix the footer information in _footer.html_

8) Check the status of the current state of the working directory:
```
$ git status
```
9) Added changes onto git:
```
$ git add footer.html
```
10) Commit changes with a message:
```
$ git commit -m 'Corrected name and URL of footer')
```
11) Push changes to the fork:
```
$ git push -u myfork BRANCH_NAME)
```

## Code Triage

### Projects Picked:
* [Atom](https://www.codetriage.com/atom/atom)
* [Go Continuous Delivery (GoCD)](https://www.codetriage.com/gocd/gocd)

I made an account on code triage by linking my GitHub account to it. To my surprised, I was suddenly swarmed with many projects, and was not sure how to choose one. I ended up subscribing to [GoCD](https://github.com/gocd/gocdJAVA) because not only was it one of the first projects to show up under the JAVA filter, but the details on the [project website](https://www.gocd.org/) looked interesting.

My story for picking Atom is a little less adventurous compared to GoCD: Atom is my usual go-to editor when working on unix-based machines (such as those on the second floor in Courant Computer Lab) and the Fedora PC^2 system that the ICPC GNYR regional requires for its programming competition, so I was naturally interested in making any possible contributions to Atom.

As for the issues themselves, which came from my email subscription, I had a nice experience reading and following along with the discussion, despite how old some of the issues have been known.

#### GoCD:
* [#52 Change a pipeline label using the API](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/52)
This issue details the request for enhancement of the API, so that a user can "change the label of a pipeline using the API". What interested me the most was how "old" the request was, dating back to April 16, 2014! However, the discussion has continued up to October 20, 2017, making me realize how long it can take to resolve issues in general. The discussion in general seems to be people giving small notes and support for the enhancement, but not many people talking about solutions. At one point, the issue was closed because one user believed that the fix for [another issue](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/1417) that the same user posted was the same for Issue #52. On the surface, since the other issue had code and a checklist in general for the ability "Configure a pipeline via API". But looking at the further discussion, it looks like the separate issue does not quite fix the issue of changing the pipeline label because the other issue just change the template. Then, after some addition discussions, include some on the [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/go-cd-dev/lliartKY7Wo/discussion) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/gocd/gocd?at=568cfee4c5bdc5ba338e245b) [(another Gitter section)](https://gitter.im/gocd/gocd?at=568e8b868fdd3c0c382d4ed1), the issue was reopened and has never been resolved. In the end, a user "sautez" (as of the time of this blog post), posted a possible solution to allow the pipeline build a label for the API. Seeing how there's no new comment on the issue, and lack of frequent discussion in general, this issue doesn't look too important to prioritize to work on as a major developer of GoCD. But since it is not too fragile to work on, it looks like someone who is not as involved with the project could work on it.

#### Atom:
* [#2654 Editor window startup is slow](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2654)

This issue, given the response by the first user "benogle", is definitely an important one to fix, but it will unfortunately be ignored for now. This makes sense, because barring issues that completely hinder performance, fixing the 1s~2s (time given by issue poster "renatodex") extra time in startup of the editor window is not of the highest priority. In addition, "benogle" mentioned that the startup speed is "death by 1000 paper cuts. There will be no one thing that is a huge slowdown", meaning that there is no one big source of slowdown, and all of it is an accumulation of small slowdowns. Like GoCD's issue 52 (and probably many large issues in general), the discussion has continued over 3 years into 2017, but unlike GoCD's, this one has a lot more discussion, with many people given comments and screenshot on their speeds when using Atom. Unfortunately, not only because the issue is still open, but also because the more recent 2017 comments still report it too, the slowdown still seems to be an issue today. Personally, I have not noticed the slowdown, mostly because I have not paid too much attention to the startup speed when using Atom. But that may also be because the startup time for me isn't as bad due to not having many other processes open, so I can see why people may have such slowdowns though. It looks like this issue may take a while to solve, and might not be the best problem for me to tackle one right away if I am hoping to have a pull requet within a short time span. However, it might still be possible for me to be able to make some optimizations in the startup speed, but they won't be anything major enough to cut the 1s~2s slowdown the orignal poster "renatodex" experienced in the first place.

In addition to this issue, I noted that "benogle" mentioned that the development team was, at the time (June 18, 2014), working on the react editor and windows support. Thus, I made a quick search in issues for "windows" and found the [most recent issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16773) (posted "2 days ago" according to GitHub as of the time of this blog post) talking about Atom being unstables on Windows 10. Unsurprisingly, since not only is the slow startup issue still open (as of the time of th blog post), but I also have seen some screenshots of the slow speeds from Windows 10 users that commented in the previous issue, the user who created the issue post lists "It loads too slow when first opened" as his/her first bullet point. Looking at this issue, however, it seems more of a customer review/complaint of Atom as a product because he/she added exaggeration in the form of "etc, etc, etc" as "issues" with Atom and some unhappy wording the last paragraph of the post, and ended up even asksing for a possible replacement for Atom. While this all gave me a small chuckle, the issue itself did not provide much detail on possible causes of the issues, so if I were to find out more about the causes of these problems, I  would need to do further research, aside from the slow startup one.
