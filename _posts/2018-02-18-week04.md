### Fixing Course Website Issue
* [Original Issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/5)
* [Pull Request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/53)
#### After my Claim was Approved
After claiming my issue, I decided that, because the issue is relatively easy to fix, I would just made the change on the GitHub website itself. Thus, after Joanna approved my claim, I went to the source of the issue in the footer.html file on [line 5](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/footer.html#L5) and changed "Fall 2017" to "Spring 2018". While the URL of the calendar was disccused (the current one links to the correct NYU Academic calendar page, but incorrect section of Fall 2017), I was not sure if I should be the one making the change because [another issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/23) detailed the problem, and I did not want to take away a change that another student might needed to make. Afterwards, I made my commit, pull request, and asked (Ryan)[https://github.com/rchau0623] to verify if my change was adequate or not.

#### Making an Additional Fix
Later, Joanna clarified that, because the URL was discussed in the issue, I should be making that fix as well. Thus, I needed to made another commit on [line 5](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/footer.html#L5) again, by changing
```
http://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/university-academic-calendar.html#1168
```
to
```
https://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/university-academic-calendar.html#1184
```
While making the additional fix was not hard, I did not know how to make another commit within the same pull request. A quick Google search did not yield a clear answer, so I decided that worse comes to worst, I would create [another pull request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/57) and refernece it in a comment in my first one, and if I so happen to learn how to create another commit within the same pull request in the future, I would close my second post.

...Unfortunately, I shortly learned how to make a new commit moments after I made my second post. Thus, I embarrassingly closed my second post and made the additional commit on my first one.

#### Running Git through Terminal
If I somehow couldn't make the changes on the GitHub website, then I would have ran these commands on my terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git
$ git push
$ git pull ???
```

(My thanks to Dora and Daisy for providing the source of the footer issue and link for correct calendar, respectively)

### Code Triage
I made an account on code triage by linking my GitHub account to it. To my surprised, I was suddenly swarmed with many projects, and was not sure how to choose one. I ended up subscribing to [gocd](https://github.com/gocd/gocdJAVA) because not only was it one of the first projects to show up under the JAVA filter, but the details on the [project website](https://www.gocd.org/) looked interesting.

-------------------
#### This week's blog:
In your blogs for this week describe the following things:
1) Post the link to the pull request that you submitted. Describe step by step what you did to complete the fix and the pull request. You should specifiy all git commands you executed and any other steps that were required. (Basically describe what you did from the momemnt you got the issue to be fixed assigned to you, untill you submitted the pull request). 

2) Describe your code triage experience so far. List the projects that you selected when you signed up for the website. Specify the bugs/issues that you examined based on the emails that you got from the CodeTriage website (if you have not gotten any emails, then change your settings so you start receiving them). For each bug/issue that you examined describe what you thought about it (even if you did not end up taking any action on the bug/issue itself).
If you do not complete the pull request for the website fix by the end of Sunday, simply add the response to part 1 early next week when you get it done.
