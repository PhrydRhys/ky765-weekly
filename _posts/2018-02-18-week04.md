## Fixing Course Website Issue
* [Original Issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/5)
* [Pull Request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/53)
#### After my Claim was Approved
After claiming my issue, I decided that, because the issue is relatively easy to fix, I would just made the change on the GitHub website itself. Thus, after Joanna approved my claim, I went to the source of the issue in the footer.html file on [line 5](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/footer.html#L5) and changed "Fall 2017" to "Spring 2018". While the URL of the calendar was disccused (the current one links to the correct NYU Academic calendar page, but incorrect section of Fall 2017), I was not sure if I should be the one making the change because [another issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/23) detailed the problem, and I did not want to take away a change that another student might needed to make. Afterwards, I made my commit, pull request, and asked [Ryan](https://github.com/rchau0623) to verify if my change was adequate or not.

#### Making an Additional Fix
Later, Joanna clarified that, because the URL was discussed in the issue, I should be making that fix as well. Thus, I needed to made another commit on [line 5](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/footer.html#L5) again, by changing the anchor for the calendar page, and also adding the secure tag for HTTP:
```
http://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/university-academic-calendar.html#1168
```
to
```
https://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/university-academic-calendar.html#1184
```
While making the additional fix was not hard, I did not know how to make another commit within the same pull request. A quick Google search did not yield a clear answer, so I decided that worse comes to worst, I would create [another pull request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/57) and refernece it in a comment in my first one, and if I so happen to learn how to create another commit within the same pull request in the future, I would close my second post.

...Unfortunately, I shortly learned how to make a new commit moments after I made my second post. Thus, I embarrassingly closed my second post and made the additional commit on my first one.
#### Running Git through Terminal
If I somehow couldn't make the changes on the GitHub website, then I would have gone through these steps with terminal:

1) Clone the course website repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git
```

2) Fork the repository through Github on the [course website repository](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18) to add to my own [GitHub account's repository](https://github.com/PhrydRhys/cs480_s18)

3) Add the fork address as the remote for the local repository:
```
$ git remote add myfork https://github.com/PhrydRhys/cs480_s18.git
```

4) Change into the directory of _includes to find the _footer.html_ file:
```
$ cd PATH_OF_REPO/cs480_s18/_includes/
```

5) Create a new branch for my fix:
```
$ git branch BRANCH_NAME
```
6) Switch to the new branch:
```
$ git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```
7) Fix the footer information in _footer.html_

8) Check the status of the current state of the working directory:
```
$ git status
```
9) Added changes onto git:
```
$ git add footer.html
```
10) Commit changes with a message:
```
$ git commit -m 'Corrected name and URL of footer')
```
11) Push changes to the fork:
```
$ git push -u myfork BRANCH_NAME)
```

## Code Triage

#### Projects Picked:
* [Atom](https://www.codetriage.com/atom/atom)
* [Go Continuous Delivery (GoCD)](https://www.codetriage.com/gocd/gocd)

I made an account on code triage by linking my GitHub account to it. To my surprised, I was suddenly swarmed with many projects, and was not sure how to choose one. I ended up subscribing to [GoCD](https://github.com/gocd/gocdJAVA) because not only was it one of the first projects to show up under the JAVA filter, but the details on the [project website](https://www.gocd.org/) looked interesting.

My story for picking Atom is a little less adventurous compared to GoCD: Atom is my usual go-to editor when working on unix-based machines (such as those on the second floor in Courant Computer Lab) and the Fedora PC^2 system that the ICPC GNYR regional requires for its programming competition, so I was naturally interested in making any possible contributions to Atom.

As for the issues themselves, I had a nice experience reading the 

Atom:
* [#2654 Editor window startup is slow](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2654)

This issue, given the response by the first user "benogle", is definitely an important one to fix, but it will unfortunately be ignored for now. This makes sense, because barring issues that completely hinder performance, fixing the 1s~2s (time given by issue poster "renatodex") extra time in startup of the editor window is not of the highest priority.

In addition to this issue, I noted that "benogle" mentioned that the development team was, at the time (June 18, 2014), working on the react editor and windows support. Thus, I made a quick search in issues for "windows" and found the [most recent issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16773) (posted "2 days ago" according to GitHub as of the time of this blog post) talking about Atom being unstables on Windows 10. Unsurprising, since the slow startup issue is still open (as of the time of th blog post), the user who created the issue post lists "It loads too slow when first opened" as his/her first bullet point. Looking at this issue, however, it seems more of a customer review/complaint of Atom as a product because he/she added exaggeration in the form of "etc, etc, etc" as "issues" with Atom and some unhappy wording the last paragraph of the post, and ended up even asksing for a possible replacement for Atom. While this all gave me a small chuckle, _________

#### This week's blog:
In your blogs for this week describe the following things:
1) Post the link to the pull request that you submitted. Describe step by step what you did to complete the fix and the pull request. You should specifiy all git commands you executed and any other steps that were required. (Basically describe what you did from the momemnt you got the issue to be fixed assigned to you, untill you submitted the pull request). 

2) Describe your code triage experience so far. List the projects that you selected when you signed up for the website. Specify the bugs/issues that you examined based on the emails that you got from the CodeTriage website (if you have not gotten any emails, then change your settings so you start receiving them). For each bug/issue that you examined describe what you thought about it (even if you did not end up taking any action on the bug/issue itself).

If you do not complete the pull request for the website fix by the end of Sunday, simply add the response to part 1 early next week when you get it done.
