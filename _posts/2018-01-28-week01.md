# Open Source
### What do YOU think about when you hear the term "open source"?
When I hear the term "open source", I think of of a project, not necessarily a software one, that has been created and worked on by a community. The details of the project is open to everyone and anyone can join the community to add contributions.
### What are some advantages of open vs. closed source?
Open source is, as its name states, open for anyone to access. This means that a product is freely available for all to use and modify. Such liberties allow a community to "peer-review" a product to make fixes and add new features. After all, "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow", or the more eyes that look at a product, the more refined it can become.

# Projects
### List names of four open source projects that you regularly use or that influenced you in some way in the past; give brief descriptions for each, explain why you use it and what the alternatives might be (note, the projects do not have to be source code based).
#### 1. Mozilla Firefox
Firefox is an internet browser and the first non-default browser I have used. As a web browser, it speed, security, add-ons, and ease of use makes it appealing for me to use. The continued development

Alternatives that I know off the top of my head for Firefox are Google Chrome (another browser I do like to use), Opera, and Safari for MacOS (I believe a Windows version exists, but discontinued?). I personally would never suggest Internet Explorer as an alternative because of its large flaws.
#### 2. Eclipse
Eclipse is an IDE used to write programs. I most commonly use it for writing programs in Java because not only was it the first IDE introduced to me when using Java (so I have become accustomed to use it for Java), but also because the platform provides a lot of ease of use yet a lot useful functions to use.

There are several alternatives to Eclipse as a Java IDE, which include both retail and other open source software. Examples for retail include JetBrain's InteliJ (which I have used for a previous class), and BlueJ and Netbeans for open source.
