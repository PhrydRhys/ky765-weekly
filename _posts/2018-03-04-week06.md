## Summary of Team Assesment and Plan
### Team Info:
* Project: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* GitHub Repo: https://github.com/django/django
* Teammates:
  * [Jessica Fushada](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jf2902-weekly)
  * [Kelly Hogan](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/keh474-weekly)
  * [Rohit Motwani](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/rdm403-weekly)
  * [Shiyang Wang](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/sw2741-weekly)
  * [Kenneth Yang](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/ky765-weekly)

### Assesment of Team (Mostly referenced from teammates' and my own week 5 blogs)
Strengths:
* Most of us have worked with Django & Python together in the past, teamcohesion exists
* Tenacious and persistent problem solvers
* Open and receptive to new ideas
* Experienced with Git and GitHub

Weaknesses (Mostly fears):
* Inexperienced with contibuting to larger projects such as open source ones
* Thus we are lacking in some confidence for being able to make a meaningful contribution either due to community backlash or not having the knowledge to be able to fix an issue
* Even when we found "beginner" tags in projects during Class #9, a lot of them looked intimidating and were more difficult than what we expected (Luckily Django's issue labelling for "Easy Pickings" should be what we need)

### Meeting Times (Tentative)
* Primary: Tuesday, 5-7 pm
* Alternative: Thursday, 5-7 pm

### Milestones (Referenced from our [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ykIarz5l_XlK67Zz208LM60tGsf0P6wT5kfuO4lxwdM/edit#slide=id.g324cfbbe2a_0_22) on Class #12)
1. Become familiar with Django (again): read through tutorials, documentation, Code of Conduct
2. Join the mailing lists & IRC chat to monitor, listen in on, and contribute to discussion
3. Update to the latest _development_ version of Django
4. Browse & triage the "easy pickings" tickets in the bug tracker and choose at least one to tackle
5. Run Django's test suite
6. Write tests, code, & documentation for "easy-pickings" and documentation ticket that need patches
7. Review, commit and make pull request
8. Wait for & respond to feedback
9. Repeat steps 6 to 8 for easier contributions
10. Eventually find several non-trivial issues that we feel comfortable with and attempt to make contributions
11. After becoming comfortable with “easy-pickings” and documentation issues, begin to look through issues for "intermediate contributors"

-------------------
## Open Data Week Events
* [Data Through Design: Opening Reception](http://www.open-data.nyc/#details80) (3/2 6:30-8:30 @	30 John Street, Brooklyn, NY)
* [NYC Open Data Week @ NYU](http://www.open-data.nyc/#details75) (Monday 3/5 7-9:30 @	Hemmerdinger Hall, Silver)

The opening reception was this past Friday, and the event was pretty neat (the travelling through the rain, wind, hail, & snow was another story). However, those details will be discussed on next week's blogs
