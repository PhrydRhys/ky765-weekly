## Summary of Team Assesment and Plan
### Assesment of Django
### Plans to Contributing
### Meeting Times

## Contributions this Week
* No contributions this week

## Open Data Events (Tentative, would like to attend more):
* Data Through Design: Opening Reception (3/2 6:30-8:30 @	30 John Street, Brooklyn, NY)
* NYC Open Data Week @ NYU (Monday 3/5 7-9:30 @	Hemmerdinger Hall, Silver)

The opening reception was this past Friday, and the event was pretty neat (the travelling through the rain, wind, hail, & snow was another story). However, I believe I will get into those details on next week's blogs

For this week's blogs you should just summarize what you came up with based on the "Team assesment and plan" listing on the course website. Some of those things require group consensus (like the meeting time), som of them can be done very individually (what you think the challenges will be), some of them can be done by the team or individually (selection of milestones - team goals may be somewhat different than what you personally have in mind).

As before, you should also summarize all your contributions.

Also, mention which of the open data week events you are planning to attend (or are attending since they are starting today)
