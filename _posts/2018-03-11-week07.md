# Open Data Week Events

### [Data Through Design: Opening Reception](https://www.open-data.nyc/#details80)
##### Friday 3/2 6:30-8:30 @ 30 John Street, Brooklyn, NY

That Friday had wonderful weather, and the journey was even more fun (slight sarcasm)! I was at the opening reception with friends & classmates Ryan Chau, Ashley Hu, Dana Lee, and Dora Sun. The event was an art exhibit with each piece detailing some kind of data, ranging from trees & car accidents in Manhattan, to sexual violence in NYC, to Haikus describing NYC government jobs.

(describe the art)

The construction and presentation of each art piece was definitely a nice touch to visualize the data, but while the art looked nice and gave a nice glimpse into the data and its significance, Dana mentioned a point that I definitely agreed on: for someone who has worked with data a lot, the exhibit doesn't really show that much. And even though the presentation might be simplified in order to allow the general public comprehend the data more easily, I was kind of yearning for more insight and analysis of the data. Perhaps that is a sign for me to look more into Open Data and attend more events in the future.
