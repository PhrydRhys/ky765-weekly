# Open Data Week Events

### [Data Through Design: Opening Reception](https://www.open-data.nyc/#details80)
##### Friday 3/2 6:30-8:30 @ 30 John Street, Brooklyn, NY

That Friday had wonderful weather, and the journey was even more fun (slight sarcasm)! I was at the opening reception with friends & classmates Ryan Chau, Ashley Hu, Dana Lee, and Dora Sun. The event was an art exhibit with each piece detailing some kind of data, ranging from trees & car accidents in Manhattan, to sexual trauma in NYC, to haikus describing NYC government jobs. The two most memorable art pieces are the occurences of Sexual Trauma visualization and Haiku Generator, not only because both of them were the most visually flamboyant (the size is definitely a huge factor for my rememberance of those two), but also because of the implications of the data it presented and the algorithm used for the Sexual Trauma and Haiku Generator, respectively.

#### Sexual Trauma
The other memorable art piece is the one regarding the sexual trauma over time. The large 24-hour clock and calendar display was powered by arduino equiment in the back (regretably no photos to show the arduino) and used data from the NYPD Compliant Data Historic to show, at a given time of day, which days in the year were there sexual violence, with the white LEDs signaling general assaults and red one detailing more severe one. A scary general observation was that as the clock hits the evening times, more and more LEDs lit up, and more and more LEDs showed red. While I was aware that sexual violence is prevalent in the city, I was definitely startled when I saw how bright the calendar got at certain times.

#### The Haiku Generator
The Haiku Generator has a machine that has a button which you can press to generate a haiku describing an NYC Government job. The machine is connected to a larger screen (which I unfortunately did not take a picture of), which types out the haiku, and then when it finishes, the machine prints out the haiku which can be used as a nametag or label (it prints on a adhesive plate label). An example haiku generated for "Public Health Assistant" was:
```
Explain testing and
clinical procedures to
customers patients
```
But aside from the visuals, the more intersting part of this is the algorithm and the Markov Chain models it uses to determine what the next word will be in the poem (more detail in the images below), which you can see when the generator types out. Sometimes, because it is unable to appropriately describe a job while maitaining the 5-7-5 syllable structure of a haiku, you can see the generator erase some words and rewrite the poem. In some extreme cases during that evening, I've seen the generator scrap an almost-complete poem and restart from the beginning. While some people may criticize the algorithm for not being optimal because of the possible number of backspaces needed to be done in order to produce an adequate poem may be large, I personally find that aspect endearing because it emulates a human's creation process of not just haikus, but also in projects in general; when contributing to a project, you may need to backtrack or scrap some work in order to create a satisfactory end product.

I actually found a funny haiku, which prints out, from what I assume, the contents of the "Readme.md" of this project:
```
Please press the button
to generate another
NYC haiku
```
Since we have been working with GitHub a lot, not only as just a platform to do these blogs or upload source code, but also as a version control system for project collaboration such as reporting issues and submiting pull requests, I found it enthralling to see the Haiku Generator to print this haiku out, despite not being an NYC Government job.

#### Minor Criticism
The construction and hands-on presentation of each art piece was definitely a nice touch to visualize the data, and I definitely enjoyed the exhibit. However, while the art looked nice and gave a nice glimpse into the data and its significance, Dana mentioned a point that I definitely agreed on: for someone who has worked with data a lot, the exhibit doesn't really show that much. And even though the presentation might be simplified in order to allow the general public comprehend the data more easily, I was kind of yearning for more insight and analysis of the data. Perhaps that is a sign for me to look more into Open Data and attend more events in the future.
