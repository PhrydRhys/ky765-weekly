# Open Data Week Events

### [Data Through Design: Opening Reception](https://www.open-data.nyc/#details80)
##### Friday 3/2 6:30-8:30 @ 30 John Street, Brooklyn, NY

That Friday had wonderful weather, and the journey was even more fun (slight sarcasm)! I was at the opening reception with friends & classmates Ryan Chau, Ashley Hu, Dana Lee, and Dora Sun. The event was an art exhibit with each piece detailing some kind of data, ranging from trees & car accidents in Manhattan, to sexual trauma in NYC, to haikus describing NYC government jobs. The two most memorable art pieces are the occurences of Sexual Trauma visualization and Haiku Generator, not only because both of them were the most visually flamboyant (the size is definitely a huge factor for my rememberance of those two), but also because of the implications of the data it presented and the algorithm used for the Sexual Trauma and Haiku Generator, respectively.

#### Sexual Trauma
The other memorable art piece is the one regarding the sexual trauma over time. The large 24-hour clock and calendar display was powered by arduino equiment in the back (regretably no photos to show the arduino) and used data from the NYPD Compliant Data Historic to show, at a given time of day, which days in the year were there sexual violence, with the white LEDs signaling general assaults and red one detailing more severe one. A scary general observation was that as the clock hits the evening times, more and more LEDs lit up, and more and more LEDs showed red. While I was aware that sexual violence is prevalent in the city, I was definitely startled when I saw how bright the calendar got at certain times.

#### The Haiku Generator
The Haiku Generator has a machine that has a button which you can press to generate a haiku describing an NYC Government job. The machine is connected to a larger screen (which I unfortunately did not take a picture of), which types out the haiku, and then when it finishes, the machine prints out the haiku which can be used as a nametag or label (it prints on a adhesive plate label). An example haiku generated for "Public Health Assistant" was:
```
Explain testing and
clinical procedures to
customers patients
```
But aside from the visuals, the more intersting part of this is the algorithm and the Markov Chain models it uses to determine what the next word will be in the poem (more detail in the images below), which you can see when the generator types out. Sometimes, because it is unable to appropriately describe a job while maitaining the 5-7-5 syllable structure of a haiku, you can see the generator erase some words and rewrite the poem. In some extreme cases during that evening, I've seen the generator scrap an almost-complete poem and restart from the beginning. While some people may criticize the algorithm for not being optimal because of the possible number of backspaces needed to be done in order to produce an adequate poem may be large, I personally find that aspect endearing because it emulates a human's creation process of not just haikus, but also in projects in general; when contributing to a project, you may need to backtrack or scrap some work in order to create a satisfactory end product.

I actually found a funny haiku, which prints out, from what I assume, the contents of the "Readme.md" of this project:
```
Please press the button
to generate another
NYC haiku
```
Since we have been working with GitHub a lot, not only as just a platform to do these blogs or upload source code, but also as a version control system for project collaboration such as reporting issues and submiting pull requests, I found it enthralling to see the Haiku Generator to print this haiku out, despite not being an NYC Government job.

#### Minor Criticism
The construction and hands-on presentation of each art piece was definitely a nice touch to visualize the data, and I definitely enjoyed the exhibit. However, while the art looked nice and gave a nice glimpse into the data and its significance, Dana mentioned a point that I definitely agreed on: for someone who has worked with data a lot, the exhibit doesn't really show that much. And even though the presentation might be simplified in order to allow the general public comprehend the data more easily, I was kind of yearning for more insight and analysis of the data. Perhaps that is a sign for me to look more into Open Data and attend more events in the future.

### [NYC Open Data Week @ NYU](https://www.open-data.nyc/#details75)
##### Monday 3/5 7-9:30 @ Hemmerdinger Hall, Silver

While the Opening Reception was a nice way to visualize the use of open data, the event did not have any speakers who explained the importance of open data. Luckily, I was able to learn a lot from Monday's evening about the purpose and role of Open Data in our society in the event. The event started off the first hour with a one-hour panel with a representative of the [NYU BUGS Open Source Club](https://bugs-nyu.github.io/open-data/open_data_week.html) asking question to the three speakers:
* Dinorah Cantu-Pedraza - The GovLab Academy Coordinator
* Dominic Mauro - Assistant General Counsel, NYC Department of Information technology & Telecommunications, Open Data Team
* Vicky Steeves - Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility
Then the remaining time was an open floor for attendees to look at data exhibits from other student. I kind of wished I was more informed about open data and the issues surrounding it so I could better understand the talk and ask some questions. I also would have liked a bit more time on the panel for more questions because several good ones were asked. However, my stomach at the time might have not agreed with my hindsight because I do remember being hungry and happy to relish the food (the food was pretty good).

#### Panel Discussion
The panel actually enlightened me a lot, informing me the reasons for the need and importance of Open Data. One point that was stressed was that while data should be open, it should also be **well documented**, meaning that the data is easily accessable and read. This make sense of course, as if you just shared me a spreadsheet with no labels and explanations, then how would I know what that data means? This is also important in software-based projects, as documentation is necessary to instruct your users on how to interpret the packages and information received. Another interesting point for the support of open data is that it removes the need to re-aquire data, thus effectively eliminating repeated work. Of course, sometimes repeating the data collection is important to verify accuracy, and that will be discussed in more detail in the next paragraph. Lastly, I found the idea of alternatives to open data, if open data or the concept of it did not exist. I believe Dominic mentioned that one alternative would be the Freedom of Infomation Law (FOIL), which would not be that great of an alternative, but still one nonetheless. Dinorah mentioned that there would be organizations such as BUGS that would form agreements with agencies or corporations on the sharing of the data, and this extra barrier of contracts and agreements would be the alternative if data was not open. Such responses about these alternatives, assuming all alternatives are inferior to data being open, makes me appreciate the development and spread of open data a lot more.

During the questions-from-the-audience portion of the panel, a student asked about the issue of inaccurate or fake data being shared openly, and Dominic shared a funny anecdote from his personal work experience regarding hip replacement costs in NYC and Upstate NY. He stated that the aberage costs reported by the hospitals in NYC and Upstate NY were $10,000 and $700 respectively. Because people saw these numbers, many people flocked to hospitals in Upstate NY, only to disappointed that the costs were much higher than $700. What happened was that the hospital in Upstate NY, while required to share the costs of the operations it performs, did not take the time to report real numbers and just made them up. The moral Dominic wanted use to take away from this example was that, while data shared may be initially inaccurate, it can only become more and more accurate as more and more people share and verify the open data, thus highlighting the need for open data.

#### Restaraunt Health Inspection Exhibit
In the second half, I got to visit an exhibit showing the grades of restaraunt health rating by colleague Danny Vilela. When health inspectors evaluate a restaurant, they give it a numerical score based on points, which can be accumulated based on health violations seen by the inspector (ie. the lower the score the better). A letter grade based on how many points, with A being 0-13pts, B is 14-27, and C for 28+ points (More details: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/how-we-score-grade.pdf). The data he presented was rather alarming; Danny had a bar graph showing the health inspection scores of the restaurant in NYC, and one could see how many restaurants were given an A, but were on the cusp of being a B, which led to him discussing a bit into what he called a "Kindness Bias," where some health inspectors will, instead of giving a numerical score of 14 which will be a B score. they will graciously assign it an A with 13 points.

There was another bar graph showing the average score of each kind of restraunt, and each average is done for every borough. The data agreed on my expections of seeing Chinese and other Asian restaraunts having a high number. However, I also saw that German restaurants had an alarmingly high number also (I forgotten which borough though). However, Danny did mention that he took the average of all the restaraunts & did not account for outliers, and also did not factor in the possibility of only a few restaurants representing its ethnicity in its borough, thus having a sample size that may be too small. While the general presentation looks reasonable, if further analysis is to be done, then these factors should be accounted for.

Lastly, Danny had a table which showed the percentages of restaurants than transitioned from a grade X to a Y, which showed that (if I remember correctly) about 90% of restaurants stay an an A, and most other restaurants either remain what their original grade was, or change into an A during the next evaluation cycle. (I personally just like to see the use of Markov matrices or some similar method to track change in states, so the table caught my attention)

#### More About Consequences of Open Data
One aspect of open data that actually made me ponder on a lot during and after the panel is the consequences of open data. Another is simply people using the data unethically or maliciously, which involves the taxi driver profile and the NYC Fire Department's response times. While I did not visit these exhibits (that were discussed during Class #13 on 3/6 (Tuesday before this blog post is due), I did find these two examples as epitomes of possible harmful impacts of open data.

##### Taxi Drivers
One example of these adverse effects are if taxi drivers' racial information are public information, this data can be used to discriminate against them. In addition, a more grim example discuseed in class is that given the distance that a taxi driver travels and the amount of time it takes for him/her to drive that distance, it can be deduced that they are speeding. What happens if police officers use this data to retroactively issue speeding tickets to the drivers, or premptively issue a ticket based on information about a driver that typically speed? Are officers allowed to do such a thing?

##### NYC Fire Department
For NYFD, it was discussed that the response times was about 2 to 4 minutes, with some areas in Brooklyn having a time of 6 minutes(!). The extreme (and sadistically comical) example of a negative impact of this shared and open information that I came up with during our class discussion is that if I were an arsonist, I would know on average how much damage I could do to a specific part of the city. Luckily, Joanna presented a more realistic and less dark-humored example of insurance companies using price discrimination for fire insurance. Based on what region you are in, an insurance company can use this data to  charge higher price if you're in a region that has a higher NYFC response time.

Such ethical problems for taxi drivers and the fire department were conceived simply due to data becoming open, thus highlighting the importance of being aware that, despite generally having postive aspects, open data can also introduce a new can of worms.
