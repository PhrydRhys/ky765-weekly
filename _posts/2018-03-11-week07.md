# Open Data Week Events

### [Data Through Design: Opening Reception](https://www.open-data.nyc/#details80)
##### Friday 3/2 6:30-8:30 @ 30 John Street, Brooklyn, NY

That Friday had wonderful weather, and the journey was even more fun (slight sarcasm)! I was at the opening reception with friends & classmates Ryan Chau, Ashley Hu, Dana Lee, and Dora Sun. The event was an art exhibit with each piece detailing some kind of data, ranging from trees & car accidents in Manhattan, to sexual trauma in NYC, to haikus describing NYC government jobs. The two most memorable art pieces are the occurences of Sexual Trauma visualization and Haiku Generator, not only because both of them were the most visually flamboyant (the size is definitely a huge factor for my rememberance of those two), but also because of the implications of the data it presented and the algorithm used for the Sexual Trauma and Haiku Generator, respectively.

#### Sexual Trauma
The other memorable art piece is the one regarding the sexual trauma over time. The large 24-hour clock and calendar display was powered by arduino equiment in the back (regretably no photos to show the arduino) and used data from the NYPD Compliant Data Historic to show, at a given time of day, which days in the year were there sexual violence, with the white LEDs signaling general assaults and red one detailing more severe one. A scary general observation was that as the clock hits the evening times, more and more LEDs lit up, and more and more LEDs showed red. While I was aware that sexual violence is prevalent in the city, I was definitely startled when I saw how bright the calendar got at certain times.

#### The Haiku Generator
The Haiku Generator has a machine that has a button which you can press to generate a haiku describing an NYC Government job. The machine is connected to a larger screen (which I unfortunately did not take a picture of), which types out the haiku, and then when it finishes, the machine prints out the haiku which can be used as a nametag or label (it prints on a adhesive plate label). An example haiku generated for "Public Health Assistant" was:
```
Explain testing and
clinical procedures to
customers patients
```
But aside from the visuals, the more intersting part of this is the algorithm and the Markov Chain models it uses to determine what the next word will be in the poem (more detail in the images below), which you can see when the generator types out. Sometimes, because it is unable to appropriately describe a job while maitaining the 5-7-5 syllable structure of a haiku, you can see the generator erase some words and rewrite the poem. In some extreme cases during that evening, I've seen the generator scrap an almost-complete poem and restart from the beginning. While some people may criticize the algorithm for not being optimal because of the possible number of backspaces needed to be done in order to produce an adequate poem may be large, I personally find that aspect endearing because it emulates a human's creation process of not just haikus, but also in projects in general; when contributing to a project, you may need to backtrack or scrap some work in order to create a satisfactory end product.

I actually found a funny haiku, which prints out, from what I assume, the contents of the "Readme.md" of this project:
```
Please press the button
to generate another
NYC haiku
```
Since we have been working with GitHub a lot, not only as just a platform to do these blogs or upload source code, but also as a version control system for project collaboration such as reporting issues and submiting pull requests, I found it enthralling to see the Haiku Generator to print this haiku out, despite not being an NYC Government job.

#### Minor Criticism
The construction and hands-on presentation of each art piece was definitely a nice touch to visualize the data, and I definitely enjoyed the exhibit. However, while the art looked nice and gave a nice glimpse into the data and its significance, Dana mentioned a point that I definitely agreed on: for someone who has worked with data a lot, the exhibit doesn't really show that much. And even though the presentation might be simplified in order to allow the general public comprehend the data more easily, I was kind of yearning for more insight and analysis of the data. Perhaps that is a sign for me to look more into Open Data and attend more events in the future.

### [NYC Open Data Week @ NYU](https://www.open-data.nyc/#details75)
##### Monday 3/5 7-9:30 @ Hemmerdinger Hall, Silver

While the Opening Reception was a nice way to visualize the use of open data, the event did not have any speakers who explained the importance of open data. Luckily, I was able to learn a lot from Monday's evening about the purpose and role of Open Data in our society in the event. The event started off the first hour with a one-hour panel with a representative of the NYU BUGS club asking question to the three speakers, (insert speaker names and the company they represent), and then the remaining time was an open floor for attendees to look at data exhibits from other student.

#### Panel Discussion
The panel actually enlightened me a lot, informing me the reasons for the need and importance of Open Data.

(insert more panel details)

#### Restaraunt Health Inspection Exhibit
In the second half, I got to visit an exhibit showing the grades of restaraunt health rating by colleague Danny Vilela.

(insert your thoughts here)

#### Consequences of Open Data
One aspect of open data that actually made me ponder on a lot during and after the panel is the consequences of open data. While I did not visit the exhibits that were discussed during Class #13 on 3/6 (Tuesday before this blog post is due), I did find the taxi driver profile and the NYC Fire Department's response times as epitomes of possible harmful impacts of open data.

##### Taxi Drivers
One example of these adverse effects are if taxi drivers' racial information are public information, this data can be used to discriminate against them. In addition, a more grim example discuseed in class is that given the distance that a taxi driver travels and the amount of time it takes for him/her to drive that distance, it can be deduced that they are speeding. What happens if police officers use this data to retroactively issue speeding tickets to the drivers, or premptively issue a ticket based on information about a driver that typically speed? Are officers allowed to do such a thing?

##### NYC Fire Department
For NYFD, it was discussed that the response times was about 2 to 4 minutes, with some areas in Brooklyn having a time of 6 minutes(!). The extreme (and sadistically comical) example of a negative impact of this shared and open information that I came up with during our class discussion is that if I were an arsonist, I would know on average how much damage I could do to a specific part of the city. Luckily, Joanna presented a more realistic and less dark-humored example of insurance companies using price discrimination for fire insurance. Based on what region you are in, an insurance company can use this data to  charge higher price if you're in a region that has a higher NYFC response time.

Such ethical problems for taxi drivers and the fire department were conceived simply due to data becoming open, thus highlighting the importance of being aware that, despite generally having postive aspects, open data can also introduce a new can of worms.
