Just in case some of you did not realized it, this weeks blog posts are supposed to be reports on the Open Data Week events that you attended. You should specify which event it was, what was discussed, what you learned, what you liked and disliked about it.

Make sure to include a photo of yourself at the event (preferably somehow indicating that you are at the particular event, not at a party) or send such picture to me by email.
