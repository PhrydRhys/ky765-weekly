## Group Project


## Licenses


## Contributions
This week, I edited the [Missing square puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Missing_square_puzzle&oldid=837257799) page. ([contribution page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/PhrydRhys)) I felt that the wording for the "Similar Puzzles" section was a bit choppy because I myself had trouble understanding what the explanation was trying to communicate.

I looked more into Open Maps to label places in the area around where I live, and it seems that most areas have already been labeled (-_-).

Blog posts for this week:
- report on team project progress - concentrating on your own contributions to the team
- look at the license for the project that your team is working on and determine what are the rules established by that license (what can one do, what is not allowed, what must one do)
- You should also update your "contributions" table with any new contributions (do not include the team work in there).
